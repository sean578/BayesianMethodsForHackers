    "\n",
    "$$ L( \\theta, \\hat{\\theta} ) = f( \\theta, \\hat{\\theta} )$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point of loss functions is that it measures how *bad* our current estimate is: the larger the loss, the worse the estimate is according to the loss function. A simple, and very common, example of a loss function is the *squared-error loss*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L( \\theta, \\hat{\\theta} ) = ( \\theta -  \\hat{\\theta} )^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The squared-error loss function is used in estimators like linear regression, UMVUEs and many areas of machine learning. We can also consider an asymmetric squared-error loss function, something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L( \\theta, \\hat{\\theta} ) = \\begin{cases} ( \\theta -  \\hat{\\theta} )^2 & \\hat{\\theta} \\lt \\theta \\\\\\\\ c( \\theta -  \\hat{\\theta} )^2 & \\hat{\\theta} \\ge \\theta, \\;\\; 0\\lt c \\lt 1 \\end{cases}$$\n",

A situation where this might be useful is in estimating web traffic for the next month, where an over-estimated outlook is preferred so as to avoid an underallocation of server resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "A negative property about the squared-error loss is that it puts a disproportionate emphasis on large outliers. This is because the loss increases quadratically, and not linearly, as the estimate moves away. That is, the penalty of being three units away is much less than being five units away, but the penalty is not much greater than being one unit away, though in both cases the magnitude of difference is the same:\n",
    "\n",

    "This loss function imposes that large errors are *very* bad. A more *robust* loss function that increases linearly with the difference is the *absolute-loss*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L( \\theta, \\hat{\\theta} ) = | \\theta -  \\hat{\\theta} | $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Historically, loss functions have been motivated from 1) mathematical convenience, and 2) they are robust to application, i.e., they are objective measures of loss. The first reason has really held back the full breadth of loss functions. With computers being agnostic to mathematical convenience, we are free to design our own loss functions, which we take full advantage of later in this Chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the second point, the above loss functions are indeed objective, in that they are most often a function of the difference between estimate and true parameter, independent of signage or payoff of choosing that estimate. This last point, its independence of payoff, causes quite pathological results though. Consider our hurricane example above: the statistician equivalently predicted that the probability of the hurricane striking was between 0% to 1%. But if he had ignored being precise and instead focused on outcomes (99% chance of no flood, 1% chance of flood), he might have advised differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "By shifting our focus from trying to be incredibly precise about parameter estimation to focusing on the outcomes of our parameter estimation, we can customize our estimates to be optimized for our application.

    "##  Loss functions in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been under the unrealistic assumption that we know the true parameter. Of course if we knew the true parameter, bothering to guess an estimate is pointless. Hence a loss function is really only practical when the true parameter is unknown. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian inference, we have a mindset that the unknown parameters are really random variables with prior and posterior distributions. Concerning the posterior distribution, a value drawn from it is a *possible* realization of what the true parameter could be. Given that realization, we can compute a loss associated with an estimate. As we have a whole distribution of what the unknown parameter could be (the posterior), we should be more interested in computing the *expected loss* given an estimate. This expected loss is a better estimate of the true loss than comparing the given loss from only a single sample from the posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "First it will be useful to explain a *Bayesian point estimate*. The systems and machinery present in the modern world are not built to accept posterior distributions as input. It is also rude to hand someone over a distribution when all they asked for was an estimate.  In the course of an individual's day, when faced with uncertainty we still act by distilling our uncertainty down to a single action. Similarly, we need to distill our posterior distribution down to a single value (or vector in the multivariate case). If the value is chosen intelligently, we can avoid the flaw of frequentist methodologies that mask the uncertainty and provide a more informative result.The value chosen, if from a Bayesian posterior, is a Bayesian point estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $P(\\theta | X)$ is the posterior distribution of $\\theta$ after observing data $X$, then the following function is understandable as the *expected loss of choosing estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ to estimate $\\theta$*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l(\\hat{\\theta} ) = E_{\\theta}\\left[ \\; L(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}) \\; \\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also known as the *risk* of estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$. The subscript $\\theta$ under the expectation symbol is used to denote that $\\theta$ is the unknown (random) variable in the expectation, something that at first can be difficult to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "We spent all of last chapter discussing how to approximate expected values. Given $N$ samples $\\theta_i,\\; i=1,...,N$ from the posterior distribution, and a loss function $L$, we can approximate the expected loss of using estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ by the Law of Large Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\;L(\\theta_i, \\hat{\\theta} ) \\approx E_{\\theta}\\left[ \\; L(\\theta, \\hat{\\theta}) \\; \\right]  = l(\\hat{\\theta} ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that measuring your loss via an *expected value* uses more information from the distribution than the MAP estimate which, if you recall, will only find the maximum value of the distribution and ignore the shape of the distribution. Ignoring information can over-expose yourself to tail risks, like the unlikely hurricane, and leaves your estimate ignorant of how ignorant you really are about the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, compare this with frequentist methods, that traditionally only aim to minimize the error, and do not consider the *loss associated with the result of that error*. Compound this with the fact that frequentist methods are almost guaranteed to never be absolutely accurate. Bayesian point estimates fix this by planning ahead: your estimate is going to be wrong, you might as well err on the right side of wrong."

    "\n",
    "For some loss functions, the Bayes action is known in closed form. We list some of them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  If using the mean-squared loss, the Bayes action is the mean of the posterior distribution, i.e. the value $$ E_{\\theta}\\left[ \\theta \\right] $$ minimizes $E_{\\theta}\\left[ \\; (\\theta - \\hat{\\theta})^2 \\; \\right]$. Computationally this requires us to calculate the average of the posterior samples [See chapter 4 on The Law of Large Numbers]\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Whereas the *median* of the posterior distribution minimizes the expected absolute-loss. The sample median of the posterior samples is an appropriate and very accurate approximation to the true median.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  In fact, it is possible to show that the MAP estimate is the solution to using a loss function that shrinks to the zero-one loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe it is clear now why the first-introduced loss functions are used most often in the mathematics of Bayesian inference: no complicated optimizations are necessary. Luckily, we have machines to do the complications for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Machine Learning via Bayesian Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas frequentist methods strive to achieve the best precision about all possible parameters, machine learning cares to achieve the best *prediction* among all possible parameters. Of course, one way to achieve accurate predictions is to aim for accurate predictions, but often your prediction measure and what frequentist methods are optimizing for are very different. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, least-squares linear regression is the most simple active machine learning algorithm. I say active as it engages in some learning, whereas predicting the sample mean is technically *simpler*, but is learning very little if anything. The loss that determines the coefficients of the regressors is a squared-error loss. On the other hand, if your prediction loss function (or score function, which is the negative loss) is not a squared-error, like AUC, ROC, precision, etc., your least-squares line will not be optimal for the prediction loss function. This can lead to prediction results that are suboptimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Bayes actions is equivalent to finding parameters that optimize *not parameter accuracy* but an arbitrary performance measure, however we wish to define performance (loss functions, AUC, ROC, precision/recall etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two examples demonstrate these ideas. The first example is a linear model where we can choose to predict using the least-squares loss or a novel, outcome-sensitive loss. \n",

This is not too restrictive, as by construction the smaller halos have less influence on the galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tim logically assumed that the ellipticity of each galaxy is dependent on the position of the halos, the distance between the galaxy and halo, and the mass of the halos. Thus the vector of ellipticity of each galaxy, $\\mathbf{e}_i$, are *children* variables of the vector of halo positions $(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})$, distance (which we will formalize), and halo masses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tim conceived a relationship to connect positions and ellipticity by reading literature and forum posts. He supposed the following was a reasonable relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e_i | ( \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} ) \\sim \\text{Normal}( \\sum_{j = \\text{halo positions} }d_{i,j} m_j f( r_{i,j} ), \\sigma^2 ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d_{i,j}$ is the *tangential direction* (the direction in which halo $j$ bends the light of galaxy $i$), $m_j$ is the mass of halo $j$, $f(r_{i,j})$ is a *decreasing function* of the Euclidean distance between halo $j$ and galaxy $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tim's function $f$ was defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f( r_{i,j} ) = \\frac{1}{\\min( r_{i,j}, 240 ) } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "for large halos, and for small halos\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f( r_{i,j} ) = \\frac{1}{\\min( r_{i,j}, 70 ) } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This fully bridges our observations and unknown. This model is incredibly simple, and Tim mentions this simplicity was purposefully designed: it prevents the model from overfitting.  \n",

    "### Training & PyMC3 implementation\n",

    "For each sky, we run our Bayesian model to find the posteriors for the halo positions &mdash; we ignore the (known) halo position. This is slightly different than perhaps traditional approaches to Kaggle competitions, where this model uses no data from other skies nor the known halo location. That does not mean other data are not necessary &mdash; in fact, the model was created by comparing different skies. \n"
